## FreeSpace
FreeSpace: The Great War (Released 1998) and FreeSpace 2 (1999) are mission-based space combat simulators, like X-Wing/TIE Fighter and Wing Commander. Among the greatest games of the genre, they were also effectively the last.

The FreeSpace series follows humanity and their Vasudan allies as they fight to withstand the xenocidal, enigmatic Shivans, a species of unknown origin, vast technological capability, and seemingly limitless malice.

## FreeSpace Open
Thanks to Volition's generosity, we've continued development of FreeSpace 2 as FreeSpace Open, building graphical enhancements to bring the original games up to modern standards, telling new stories set in the FreeSpace universe and original worlds, and creating spectacular total conversions that let players fly in the beloved universes of Babylon 5, Battlestar Galactica, Wing Commander, and Star Wars.

## How to get the game

 - [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/273620/Freespace_2/)  
After installing retail FS2, use [Knossos](https://fsnebula.org/knossos/) to upgrade to the most recent release of FSO. Knossos is an advanced mod manager and launcher for FSO.

## Improvements

 - OpenGL support
 - OpenAL audio support

## The FreeSpace Upgrade Project
While the SCP improves the code of the game engine to enable new and exciting features, the FreeSpace Upgrade Project (FSU) creates material that takes advantage of the improved game engine.  
The FSU improves the ships, effects, and background elements of FreeSpace 2. Every now and then these improvements are released as a pack called MediaVPs. These assorted improvements enhance the graphics of the game.  
While the best way to experience the FSU is by playing the game with it, you can watch this [comparison video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM1YC_gK-qo) between 1999 and 2019 to have an idea of how much more beautiful FSU makes the game.
